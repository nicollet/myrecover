Vim plugin for diffing when swap file is found.
Greatly inspired from Christian Brabandt <cb@256bit.org> recover:

License:
Not too sure what license applies here. It should be vim if you think the VIM
license applies, or GNU GPL v2 if it does not.

Work in progress. Using vim9script.
Works for me, may not work for you, use at your own risks.
Has only been tested on MAC.
